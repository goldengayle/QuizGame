# QuizGame (Challenge #4)

## Description
This project is a quiz to test students on their understanding of atomic structure. The program currently has 8 questions, which generate at random - and has the user timed at 1 minute. Once the timer or the questions run out, the user is prompted to key in their initials and their favorite element. Their score is calculated using both time left and correct answers as metrics. High scores are stored and can be displayed based on user preference. 

## Usage
AS A USER I want to make sure my students understand atomic structure. This program allows them to answer questions, which have been randomized in order and in their answer options. Initials, score, and the users favorite element are stored (the latter property for a future use).
